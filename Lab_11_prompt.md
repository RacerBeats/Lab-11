🎯 Objective

This lab helps you understand and implement two advanced data structures: Binary Heaps and Treaps. You’ll design, implement, and test their behavior using Python, while reflecting on their algorithmic performance in different contexts.
🧩 Part 1: Design (Required)
🔷 A. Binary Min-Heap

    Purpose
    Input / Output
    Pseudocode (insert, remove, peek)
    Data representation (array-based using list)

🔷 B. Treap

    Purpose
    Input / Output
    Pseudocode (insert with priority, rotation logic, search)
    Data representation (class-based with key and priority)

🛠️ Part 2: Implementation (Use TODOs)
🔹 A. Min-Heap (Using List)

Create a new file called min_heap.py.

import heapq

class MinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []

    def insert(self, item):
        # TODO: Use heapq to insert item into the heap
        pass

    def remove_min(self):
        # TODO: Use heapq to remove and return the smallest item
        pass

    def peek_min(self):
        # TODO: Return the smallest item without removing it
        pass

🔹 B. Treap (Manual Implementation)

Create a new file called treap.py.

import random

class TreapNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.priority = random.randint(1, 100)
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Treap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def rotate_left(self, root):
        # TODO: Implement left rotation logic
        pass

    def rotate_right(self, root):
        # TODO: Implement right rotation logic
        pass

    def insert(self, root, key):
        # TODO: Insert node using BST rules
        # TODO: Apply rotations based on priority
        pass

    def search(self, root, key):
        # TODO: Search for a key using BST logic
        pass

📊 Part 3: Testing & Reflection
✅ Testing (tests.py)

Write small test cases to verify:

    Heap returns smallest value.
    Treap maintains key and priority structure.
    Search functions return expected results.

# TODO: Create MinHeap instance and test insert/remove
# TODO: Create Treap instance and test insert/search

🧠 Reflection (Submit as PDF or DOCX)

Write 1–2 paragraphs addressing:

    How does the heap maintain order with percolation?
    How do priorities help the treap stay balanced?
    When would you use a heap vs. a treap?
